            <p>I'm a PhD student in the <a href=http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/>Machine Learning Group</a> at Cambridge, supervised by <a href=http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome>Rich Turner</a>. I'm generally interested in probabilistic modelling and (approximate) inference, and how Gaussian processes should feature in probabilistic programming.</p>

            <p>The above feeds directly into my work on probabilistic machine learning in climate science, which addresses combining the predictions of ensembles of GCMs in a sensible way, and the requirements that this task places on statistical weather modelling.</p>


            <h3>Written Work</h3>

            <p>Gaussian process probabilistic programming (GPPP) is a term I've coined for the work I'm doing to re-design the way that we work with GPs in a practical sense. There will be a substantial technical report available here soon explaining what this is all about. In the mean time, I presented the high-level aspects of this work at <a href="resources/gppp_probprog.pdf">ProbProg</a> and <a href="resources/gppp_juliacon.pdf">JuliaCon</a>.

            <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07182">GPAR</a> is a multi-output Gaussian process-based regression model. It's simple, scalable by GP standards, and seems to work really well in practice. It has been accepted to AISTATS 2019, and you can find a Python implementation of the key results <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/gpar">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.06287.pdf">OILMM</a> is another multi-output Gaussian process model for regression, that's easily able to handle a lot of outputs while retaining exact inference -- Wessel came up with the main idea and I contributed the link between it and separable spatio-temporal processes, and ideas for experiments. It appeared at ICML 2020, and you can find a Python implementation of the model <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/oilmm">here</a>, and a Julia implementation <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/OILMMs.jl">here</a>.</p>


            <h3>Implementations</h3>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Stheno.jl</a> is a Julia implementation of my GPPP work. It's a WIP, but makes working with GPs in problems involving multiple related processes signficantly more straightforward than traditional GP packages. I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO3BBkGEMV8">talk</a> on it at JuliaCon 2019, the slides for which you can find <a href="resources/stheno_juliacon_2019.pdf">here</a></p>

            <p>I'm giving a talk on my package <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/TemporalGPs.jl/">TemporalGPs.jl</a> at JuliaCon 2020. You can find the slides <a href="resources/juliacon-2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
