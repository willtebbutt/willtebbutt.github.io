    <p>My <a href="mphil_thesis.html">MPhil thesis</a> was on the use of approximate variational inference in GPs when there is circulant structure present in the pseudo-point covariance matrix. The corresponding <a href="mphil_poster.html">poster</a> was presented to the course's industrial sponsors.</p>
    <p><a href=aabi_2016_circ.html>An extension</a> of this work was accepted at the NIPS workshop on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference.</p>
