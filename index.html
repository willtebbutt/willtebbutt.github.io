            <p>I'm a PhD student in the <a href=http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/>Machine Learning Group</a> at Cambridge, supervised by <a href=http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome>Rich Turner</a>. I'm generally interested in probabilistic modelling and (approximate) inference, and how Gaussian processes should feature in probabilistic programming.</p>

            <p>The above feeds directly into my work on probabilistic machine learning in climate science, which addresses combining the predictions of ensembles of GCMs in a sensible way, and the requirements that this task places on statistical weather modelling.</p>

            <h3>Written Work</h3>

            <p>Gaussian process probabilistic programming (GPPP) is a term I've coined for the work I'm doing to re-design the way that we work with GPs in a practical sense. There will be a substantial technical report available here soon explaining what this is all about. In the mean time, I presented the high-level aspects of this work at <a href="resources/gppp_probprog.pdf">ProbProg</a> and <a href="resources/gppp_juliacon.pdf">JuliaCon</a>.

            <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07182">GPAR</a> is a multi-output Gaussian process-based regression model. It's simple, scalable by GP standards, and seems to work really well in practice. It has been accepted to AISTATS 2019, and you can find a Python implementation of the key results <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/gpar">here</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="resources/gaussian-affine-posterior.pdf">Conditioning in Gaussians is an Affine Transform</a>. A (very) short presentation on a cute result that I initially found surprising. This presentation is rather terse, but the GPPP work discussed above relies on it, so a more thorough explanation of this result will be available when that work is available. Many thanks to <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/">Wessel Bruinsma</a> for sanity checking this result.</p>
            <p><a href="resources/learning-to-learn.pdf">Learning to Learn</a>: a presentation written and presented jointly with <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?portfolio=siddharth-swaroop">Siddharth Swaroop</a>. Here we review a couple of themes in the nebulously-defined sub-field of ML known as "Learning to Learn" or "Meta-Learning". This presentation is not intended to provide extensive detail for any particular work, but rather to frame two research themes in the area of Learning to Learn in a concise manner.</p> -->

            <h3>Implementations</h3>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Stheno.jl</a> is a Julia implementation of my GPPP work. It's a WIP, but makes working with GPs in problems involving multiple related processes signficantly more straightforward than traditional GP packages.</p>
